# Image Classification Model
Moodify_Image_classification.ipynb shows the baseline model that we created. We are able to get a test accuracy of 64.2% with this model. The other file tries to implement the ResNet50 model. It is a stil a work in proress. We are trying to fine tune the model to see if we are able to get any better accuracy than our baseline model.
